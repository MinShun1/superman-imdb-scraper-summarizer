"Amazing experience ❤❤ I didn't really like the new Superman, but after watching Superman, I have to say that it brought back memories of my childhood, this is the real Superman straight out of the comic books. David Corenswet is very good as Superman, Rachel Brosnahan is very suitable for the role of Lois, Nicholas Hoult is the best ex Luthor so far.. James Gunn finally showed it, as a DC fan I am very happy today that we will be able to see a good DC universe on the big screen from now on... I think people of all ages from young to old everyone gonna like this movie, Superman is beacon of hope, now I can't wait for Supergirl movie🍿 2",superman rachel brosnahan is very suitable for the role of lois nicholas hoult is the best ex luthor so far james gunn finally showed it dc fan,Superman is beacon of hope now cannot wait for supergirl movie.

"Just enjoy it for what it is The movie is fun and enjoyable. Good action and CGI. It lacks character depth and archs. / Character Development / Superman for example is the same man we meet at the start of the movie and leave at the end of the movie, nothing minor or major happens that makes him a different man: better or worse. For example: In Ironman (2008) we see Tony Stark becomes a completely new person that has new beliefs at the end of the movie. He even shuts down his own weapons department at Stark Industries. The Batman (2022) ends with Bruce finally understands he must change from a symbol of vengeance to one of hope for the people. But in Superman nothing pretty much happens to the character of Clark Kent. That goes for all characters in the movie. They all miss any character development at all. / Story and Characters / The story is very basic, one dimensional and sometimes irrelevant in the context of the movie itself which puts action and CGI fights above all. The relationship between Louis and Superman/ Clark Kent is disregard at best. Same goes for the metahumans, the Daily Planet journalists, and even the main villain (Lex Luthor) who is the only thing that will give you hope about having a good rivalry between him and Superman in the future. Nicholas Hoult (Lex Luthor) is amazing as the character but he was let down by the script. Edi Gathegi (Mr. Terrific) was good. Nathan Fillion (Guy Gardener) was okay giving the limited time he appears on the screen. Overall the secondary characters was all cast well, but the script itself didn't help the actors much. Even Skyler Gisondo did okay as (Jimmy Olsen). / Summary / If you are a general movie fan or a Marvel fan and you just want to have a good time with some laughs and smiles... this movie is for you. If you are a hardcore cinema fan who wants every movie to be as good as The Godfather or Shawshank Redemption, or as a comic book movie to be as good as Ironman and The Dark Knight and will not settle for anything less... this isn't for you. I enjoyed it for what it is. Final Score: (). 1",the movie is fun and enjoyable good action and cgi it lack character depth and arch character development superman for example is the same man we meet at the start of the movie . in ironman we see tony stark becomes completely,The movie is fun and enjoyable good action and cgi it lack character depth and arch character development.

"Better Than I Expected I've watched every Superman movie and I've been a Henry Cavill fan ever since Zack Snyder made the epic movie Man of Steel. I didn't expect Superman (2025) to be good since they got rid of Cavill and the best muscular costume Superman has ever worn. It was replaced for a more Marvel style plain costume with the dreadfully old 1930's huge red trunks. They also got rid of the awesome sonic boom flying effects and the epic musical soundtrack by the great Hans Zimmer in Man of Steel, which were a million times better than Superman (2025). But some how Superman (2025) delivered an action-packed film that kept my attention throughout the whole movie. Director James Gunn brought that topnotch Marvel story writing to the DC Universe and gave us a great movie with unexpected twists and turns. Superman (1978) will always have the best storyline since it takes you from Superman's infancy, to his teenage years, then to him as an adult. Every other Superman movie, including this one, starts with him as an adult. But still, Superman (2025) surprised me by being a very entertaining and unforgettable movie. I like it and I would recommend every Superman fan to watch it! One last thing, I thought Mister Terrific was going to be lame, but he had one of the best introductory fight scenes I had ever seen. He upstaged the rest of the Justice Gang and made me want to see a Mister Terrific movie. I'm really looking forward to what's next in the DC Universe. 1",superman got rid of cavill and the best muscular costume superman ha ever worn it wa replaced for more marvel style plain costume . superman delivered an action packed film that kept my attention throughout the whole movie director james gunn,Superman is a great movie. better than expected have watched every superman movie and have been henry cavill fan ever since zack snyder made the epic movie man of steel did not expect superman to be good since they,superman surprised me by being very entertaining and unforgettable movie like it .<n>superman will always have the best storyline since it take you from superman infancy to his teenage year .<n> mister terrific wa going to be lame but he had,better than expected have watched every superman movie and have been henry cavill fan ever since zack snyder made the epic movie man of steel did not expect superman to be good since they got rid of cavill and the best
"It's Good Fun. Plain and Simple. Superman is one of pop/culture's genuine monoliths of superhero history: he's been adapted for film, radio, television and video games and even had a stage musical in the 1960s; he's been reimagined in ways characters like Sherlock Holmes and Dracula have been similarly done to death in almost every medium. So how does this film live up to such a monumental legacy? It... is a satisfying movie. Yeah. It's not Earth-shatteringly amazing stuff that's gonna become a go-to film for directors to cite as a life-changing inspiration, but it's honest-to-God good cinematic fun and it understands Superman's raison d'être in all the ways that count. I suppose it can be summed up like this: James Gunn knows how to build a universe, but he does take it a little bit for granted, the casting is pitch-perfect for Kal-El, Lois and Lex, and the action is nicely rock-solid, but the pacing can be a little uneven as is some of the effects work (with that said, Green Lantern's effects finally don't look like total crap, but like space-crystal/glass and something that's genuinely pretty to look at); this film is trying to make Superman into DC's version of the James Bond film mythology in that the recurring motifs of the music and iconography of the characters generally speaking are carrying over from the last generation(s) of films. Superman still has a place in modern cinema indeed, and the DCU is surely gonna grow from here (still speculating who the hell they're gonna cast as Batman, The Flash, Aquaman or Wonder Woman) and I do hope James Gunn trusts other filmmakers enough to not make himself the SOLE creative force powering the screenplays and so on. It's probably gonna be too much for him alone. Superman is a star film. IMDbs. It's like comfort food cinema. It's not cutting-edge but it's more than capable of working its magic of escapism and being a 'Cape Opera'. 5",superman is star film imdbs it is like comfort food cinema it is not cutting edge but it is more than capable of working it magic of escapism and being cape opera . he is adapted for film,Superman is one of pop culture genuine monolith of superhero history.

"A Superman who can fly after a few falls. SPOILER Okay, after coming back from seeing Superman in theaters, I have to say for a reboot on the character, it was a neat movie, nothing too game changing or groundbreaking but something to have a good time with for any movie goer. While the actors are good at playing like the characters and the action is decent for the most part and cool score, the plot and the characterization are something to be desired or something that has been seen before in earlier iterations. For the Pros, I would have to give the action credit where it is due. They make the fights feel almost real especially between Superman, Engineer and Ultraman, the monster fights have good CGI. However, around the ending Superman fight the flaws in the CGI shows or feels too fake especially with the Raptors. The Score to me really carries the movie, especially the remastered 1978 Superman theme. I was unsure at first from the trailer, but I could say that it is something that makes you feel like you really want Superman to come and save the day. Some characters have nice moments, especially between Pa Kent and David Corenswet's Superman about choice makes you who you are. And Nicholas Hoult's Lex Luthor really does shine as this mastermind CEO who has it out for Superman. He makes you see the hatred quite well. Some characters have some comedic bits like Skyler Gisondo's Jimmy Olsen and Edi Gathegi's Mister Terrific and Krypto. For the Cons, to begin with is the beginning of the movie where it just feels like it just glosses over with exposition text about the current state of the DCU world. I have not really been a fan of new comic book movie iterations skipping over that and just expects me to accept how things are. Not saying that it shouldn't be a thing, I just feel that if you are going to have it, it should be done better. Like Matt Reeve's ""The Batman"", it didn't do an origin sub-plot but was able to convey the state of Gotham through visuals and score and tone. Throughout the movie, most of the time the story has extensive exposition, trying to explain their world or story how it led up to where it was without many visuals. As for Tone, while the movie's tone is supposed to be light-hearted, it has themes and plot-threads and scenes that makes it grim, it just makes it hard to feel hope at times. And even some scenes which is supposed to be dark feels ruined by some comedy bits like Trapping Krypto with him chasing Squirrels or using monkeys to make hate comments about Superman. There are certain points in times that the characters felt out of place from their comic book counterparts. Like in the interview with Superman and Lois Lane where they talk about Superman's actions, he doesn't appear apologetic and is more self-defensive, with harming enemies for the sake of protecting the innocent. Earlier, he took it personally when Jimmy calls out him losing a fight with Ultraman, it just makes him feel arrogant. For as smart as Lex Luthor was, keeping around girlfriends who are liabilities to security and secrecy of company activities is like a huge HIPPA violation. And his plans while true to his character feels like a repeat of Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor, defeating Superman, causing massive catastrophes and seeking to build his own utopia. I kind of saw that Ma and Pa Kent's characters portrayal makes them feel stereotypes of country folk making it sound like they are backward thinking in civilized society. As for the Justice Gang, I find that they kind of crowd the story which is for Superman. Without them and reworked some of the plot, there could have been more focus on character development between major characters. One thing I do not like one bit is the reveal with Superman's Kryptonian Parents being survivalists rather than hopeful parents for their son to make a better world. His Parents just wants Superman to conquer Earth among other things which would be equivalent to a Viltrumite from Invincible series or Saiyans from Dragon Ball. I know there are antagonistic Kryptonians in other iterations as well, but they at least have Superman's parents being morally decent compared to most of them. It reflects the hardships of Jerry Siegel's family that they immigrated to America for. Another thing that I noticed is that most of the story has lacked the ""show don't tell"" element to it. For example, the Hypno Glasses which makes Superman as Clark Kent appear different to everyone, yet we don't get examples of it from people's perspective, could even lead to comedic possibilities. I was indifferent mostly from the Robots in the Fortress of Solitude as they were out of the movie most of the time. Though they tried to make interactions between Superman, I felt wasn't enough. Overall, I felt like while there are quite a few plot threads and character traits in the movie I do not like. Though the characters were not all bad and the action and Musical score carries the weight for me. So, at best. 6",superman is good at playing like the character and the action is decent for the most part and cool score the plot and the characterization are something to be desired or something that ha been seen before in earlier iteration for the pro would have to,Superman is a neat movie nothing too game changing or groundbreaking but something to have good time with for any movie goer.

"A cape without the wind. SPOILER James Gunn's Superman aims to be a fresh start for the Man of Steel, but it struggles to balance comic book action and emotional depth, failing to deliver a strong conclusion. I watched this film in Japan among fans like me who grew up dreaming of superheroes. However, this movie, like many modern superhero films, feels dull and repetitive. Lex Luthor, played by Nicholas Hoult, is inconsistent: he can be intimidating one moment and childish the next. He plays dangerous games like a villain but then throws tantrums like an immature tech worker. The film tries to explain why he dislikes Superman, but it doesn't succeed. Ultraman, Superman's clone, enters the story shrouded in mystery but is activated by shouting out vitamin names like ""B12."" This approach feels awkward and more like a joke than clever storytelling. Krypto the Superdog adds some fun but disrupts key scenes, even interrupting Luthor during an important speech. Supergirl has a brief appearance that feels more like a joke than a meaningful moment. She appears, says ""Later, b***s,"" and disappears. This would be funny if we had a deeper story. The film also struggles visually; there's a world-ending threat looming while Lois and Clark share a personal moment, which is played for laughs instead of serious emotion. It's not terrible, just corny, chaotic, and easy to forget.

"Superman is fun again! Really an 8.5. Krypto alone is worth half a star. Although Krypto steals every scene he is in, there is plenty humor and heart spread around the whole cast. Even Perry White gets in a great one liner and not's even ""Don't call me Chief! Best Luthor since Hackman, and TBH, maybe even better. Hault got a lot more to work with and he used it. Corenswat and Brosnahan have great on screen chemistry and they really do a terrific job of making their character's relationship believable and compelling. Jimmy, Tessmacher, and especially the Engineer, even the Robots all had great parts. Justice Gang was great, loved the Hall, Nathan Fillon like always delivers better than the US Post Office. And they use the John Williams score so very well. They don't overuse it. Just enough to get that visceral and emotional reaction.

"This is SUPERMAN. Dc's best produced assets have always been their animated series. I felt like watching the animated series come to life today. It had plenty happening with lots of DC characters but still felt like a Superman movie and I love the direction of his growth here. Clark has always been human at heart. This is a love letter to that sentiment. The light-hearted moments are what humans genuinely experience when going through hard times - it is not misplaced but a way to cop with what is going on around you. I love Henry Cavill but Snyders heroes were on a dark path that I enjoyed but felt was too dragged out. This is our farm boy. Henry, with the right direction, could have been that too. So give this new actor a chance because this is Superman at his darkest hour and how he deals with it sings to the heart of a hero. 4",this is superman dc best produced asset have always been their animated series felt like watching the animated series come to life . but still felt like superman movie and love the direction of his growth here clark ha always been human at heart,This is superman dc best produced asset have always been their animated series felt like watching the animated series come to life today it had plenty happening with lot of dc character but still felt like superman movie and love the direction of his growth here,this is superman at his darkest hour and how he deal with it sings to the heart of hero .<n>clark ha always been human at heart this is love letter to that sentiment the light hearted moment .,this is superman dc best produced asset have always been their animated series felt like watching the animated series come to life today it had plenty happening with lot of dc character but still felt like superman movie and love the direction of his growth here cl
"Feels like a little bit of a cartoon James Gunn's Superman (2025) launches the new DC Universe with a colorful, ensemble-driven approach that sets it apart from the darker tones of previous iterations. This isn't the brooding, tortured Superman of past decades-it's a more hopeful, humorous, and cosmic reimagining that clearly carries traces of Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy style. David Corenswet steps into the role of Clark Kent / Superman with warmth and approachability. His version of the Man of Steel is sincere and likable, but at times feels less commanding both physically and emotionally compared to earlier portrayals. This Superman relies more on teamwork than sheer power, which might divide audiences who prefer a more self-reliant hero. Still, Corenswet brings an undeniable charm and sincerity to the role that fits Gunn's vision for a lighter, more humanized Superman. Nicholas Hoult's Lex Luthor, however, is the film's standout. He's sharp, unpredictable, and menacing in all the right ways. Hoult captures both the intelligence and arrogance of the character while adding a modern edge that keeps him fresh. It's easily one of the strongest interpretations of Lex Luthor to date-cunning, charismatic, and genuinely dangerous. Rachel Brosnahan delivers a capable performance as Lois Lane, showing confidence and chemistry with Corenswet, though her portrayal may not fully capture the timeless essence of the character. She brings energy and wit, but the emotional resonance between Lois and Clark feels slightly underdeveloped. Skyler Gisondo's Jimmy Olsen is an understated success. He doesn't have much screen time, but his grounded humor and genuine reactions make him feel like an essential part of the Daily Planet trio. His comedic timing works without ever feeling exaggerated. Edi Gathegi as Mr. Terrific and Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl both make memorable impressions. Their inclusion expands the world without overwhelming the story, and both actors make the most of their screen time. Mr. Terrific finally gets the attention he deserves, while Hawkgirl adds a welcome layer of grit and power to the mix. Nathan Fillion as Guy Gardner / Green Lantern is one of the more divisive choices. While Fillion's comedic instincts are solid, the overall presentation-particularly the styling and tone-feels out of step with the youthful energy of this reboot. The film seems aware of this, even poking fun at it, but the joke doesn't quite land. Krypto, Superman's canine companion, adds a dose of wild, chaotic fun. His scenes are brief but effective, providing levity in a way that feels natural to Gunn's playful storytelling sensibilities. As for the film's surprise cameo, the mystery character who appears near the end feels oddly misplaced. Without revealing who it is, this interpretation leans too heavily into humor, undercutting the gravitas of the character's legacy. It's a creative risk that will likely polarize fans. John Cena's uncredited appearance as Peacemaker, on the other hand, is short, sharp, and perfectly executed. It's a quick gag that fits Gunn's trademark humor and doesn't distract from the main narrative. Superman (2025) may not be the strongest superhero film of the year, but it's a promising and spirited start to a new DC Universe. James Gunn delivers exactly what you'd expect from his direction-heart, humor, and a sense of community among heroes. While some tonal inconsistencies and casting choices prevent it from reaching greatness, the film succeeds in reintroducing Superman for a new generation. It's a light, entertaining, and optimistic theatrical experience-one that reaffirms the character's enduring appeal while paving the way for a brighter DC future. 6",david corenswet step into the role of clark kent superman with warmth and approachability . lois lane and gisondo jimmy olsen both make memorable impression their inclusion,David corenswet step into the role of clark kent superman with warmth and approachability his version of the man of steel is sincere and likable but at time feel less commanding both physically and emotionally compared to earlier portrayal.,The film succeeds in reintroducing superman for new generation .<n>clark kent superman with warmth and approachability his version of the man of steel is sincere and likable .<n> nicholas hoult lex luthor is,feel like little bit of cartoon james gunn superman launch the new dc universe with colorful ensemble driven approach that set it apart from the darker tone of previous iteration this is not the brooding tortured superman of past decade it more hopeful humorous

"Superman (2025) is simply Way too Silly and Forgettable. I'll be straight to the point, this iteration of Superman is made for a Gen Alpha or younger. It is way too silly and campy for this universe to be taken seriously. If you look back at the Superman Animated series, which had quite a few comic book inspired themes and characters, nothing in that show felt as ""Cartoony"" as this film. The entire film felt like it was forcing comedy at every scene. Even when the stakes of the story was ramping up, the silly tone was relentless. Say what you will about Man of Steel, but the Action sequences were remarkable, the visual style coupled with the show of strength for Superman and the other Kryptonians felt powerful. However, there isn't much action to remember in this film, because every battle Superman has, he's constantly subdued or beaten down. Speaking of which, Cornsweat's portrayal of Superman wasn't how I ever thought id see Superman portrayed. His Superman whines and shouts quite allot and while he's a serviceable actor. He's nowhere near as good as Christopher Reeves, Brandon Routh or Henry Cavill. Overall, it's quite forgettable and I don't believe I'll ever feel any desire to rewatch it, it's simply mediocre and James Gunn's humor does not work for this character or DC characters in general. I feel like we're going backwards and we're heading to the Joel Schumacher comic book films. Want a strong Superman film? Watch Man of Steel (2013). Want a strong start for a Cinematic Universe?

"WBD cancelled Snyder/Cavill for this? Corenswet has the look to play Superman. James Gunn has the talent to write/direct Superman, but for some reason he makes horrible decisions. The MCU Infinity Stones saga and the 5 movies of the SnyderVerse were money making machines. The MCU and the (now) DCU have taken the what made them gauntlets and went in a different direction and the box office receipts show it. This version of Superman is a weak and whiny mess. Much like Ironheart, this movie has zero likeable characters. This movie doesn't deserve to be on the big screen. It doesn't even deserve to be on the CW! It has all the ""just bad"" to be a SyFy channel original movie, heck, the CGI is barely above any of the Sharknado movies. Don't get me started on the dog, Krypto.

Glad we're back to the heart of Superman, who he is and what he's stands for. For.people complaining he's weak. If you read the monologue at the beginning, Superman never lost a battle until now. And it explained why during the movie. So yeah you get to see him at his most vulnerable. I thought the story, the concept, colours, action are all fantastic. People took.the screenshot of a few extreme camera angle and whine about it. But when I watch it in a sequence, its stunning and personal. Krypto is a great addition. We know at the very end why he's such a naughty boy. And im looking forward to seeing more of him. And lastly Lex is absolutely incredible. This movie has heart. I cry a few times and thankfully no light in the cinema :) This is a great start to the DCU universe. Im looking forward to see what's next. 1",superman and lois chemistry are through the roof would love more of their adventure together in the future movie mr terrific is so awesome the fight choreography is gorgeous with all the tspheres also love the elemental man so many,Superman and lois chemistry is through the roof would love more of their adventure together in the future movie mr terrific is so awesome the fight choreography is gorgeous with all the tspheres also love the elemental man so many incredible character im,i hope absolutely loving it superman and lois chemistry is through the roof would love more of their adventure together .<n>lex is absolutely incredible this movie ha heart cry few time and thankfully no light in the cinema this is great start to the,hope absolutely loving it superman and lois chemistry is through the roof would love more of their adventure together in the future movie mr terrific is so awesome the fight choreography is gorgeous with all the tspheres also love the elemental man so
"Superman This movie actually represented what superman should be,i love Zack Snyder's Man of Steel the aesthetics were crazy good but superman was not the hopeful character I grew up with in man of steel,While this movie did justice to Superman character. The Bgm was crazy good. Superman saving people and animals while fighting represented our boy scout and his morales, though I like Cavil as superman more than David corenswet. All the others cast did a pretty good job, I want to see more of this universe now. This movie made me hopeful again ,to trust on DC. James Gunn really did justice to our boy scout. 4",superman this movie actually represented what superman should be love zack snyder man of steel the aesthetic were crazy good but superman wa not the hopeful character grew up with . this movie did justice to superman character,This movie did justice to superman character the bgm wa crazy good superman saving people and animal while fighting represented our boy scout and his morale. like cavil superman more than david corenswet all the others cast did pretty,superman this movie actually represented what superman should be love zack snyder man of steel the aesthetic were crazy good but superman wa not the hopeful character grew up with in man of steel while this movie did justice to superman,superman this movie actually represented what superman should be love zack snyder man of steel the aesthetic were crazy good but superman wa not the hopeful character grew up with in man of steel while this movie did justice to superman character

"Hollow story and bad acting Gunn delivered with the Guardians Franchise, even with the last of them being the worst and only a shadow of the first one. Sadly he continued his path downwards with this movie. It should not be rated from 12 years, but for 12 year olds. What a bad and way to easy story. Why using the war of Russia and Ukraine as the backstory and then putting them into the desert again? Where are drones and city warfare, which could have been used (all other parties using drones the whole time) and really made a statement, but in the chosen way, the message is getting destroyed by a more general and not even remotely touching theme. The cast is hollow as well. Only a few sparks of good face and body acting. The villans are the worst acting I have seen in a long time. The hero party is also not impressive at all and I could not relate or feel any of them, even if a few known faces had been chosen, which have proven better acting in the past. So for me the cast had been used quite wrong and where not given the right character acting they would have deserved. A very bad movie. 3",hollow story and bad acting gunn delivered with the guardian franchise even though the last of them being the worst and only shadow of the first one sadly he continued his path downwards with this movie it should not be rated from year,The cast is hollow well only few spark of good face and body acting the villans are the worst acting have seen in long time the hero party is also not impressive at all and could not relate or feel any of them even if few known,hollow story and bad acting gunn delivered with the guardian franchise even with the last of them being the worst and only shadow of the first one sadly he continued his path downwards with this movie it should not be rated from year but for year old what,hollow story and bad acting gunn delivered with the guardian franchise even with the last of them being the worst and only shadow of the first one sadly he continued his path downwards with this movie it should not be rated from year but for year old
"Supermess What am I watching right now? (yes writing this while in the movies) I cannot believe my eyes. While watching this, I keep performing reality checks (counting fingers both of my hands) because I can't believe this is a real experience. I did not obviously understand this is a parody, this is a grotesque. It's is like a C production of a Buffy, the vampire slayer. The cast is absolutely horrendous. The acing even worse. While the Man of steel was a serious superhero movie and still is underrated... This is a whole another dimesion and is not a good one. I was a bit late for the start of the movie, and upon entering the theater I thought a trailer for some christmas movie was on (some dog with a red cape and a whole lot of snow).

"Average movie.. SPOILER Superman (2025) - Movie Review Superman (2025) is an average watch that doesn't quite live up to the expectations. While there are a few fun and entertaining moments, the overall story feels weak and uninspiring. The plot lacks depth, and the emotional connection just isn't there. Visually it's fine, and there's some charm in places, but nothing truly stands out. If I go by the story alone, I'd rate it around 5 or 6 out of 10.

"This is superman, everybody This film flawlessly embodies Superman. Gunn's film demonstrates and showcases everything DC can offer in the hands of this man. David Corenswet plays a very good role as Clark, as does Rachel as Louis, and the chemistry between them is incredibly good and works very well. But among the cast, I must highlight Hoult's sublime performance as Lex Luthor; it's simply outstanding. I must highlight the role of the character Krypto, who at times completely steals the show. And as a DC fan, I have to say that finally, a director has managed to show what Superman is all about, and it's a love letter to the character and the fans. 1",this is superman everybody this film flawlessly embodies superman gunn film demonstrates and showcase everything dc can offer in this man david corenswet play very good role clark doe rachel lou,This film flawlessly embodies superman gunn film demonstrates and showcase everything dc can offer in the hand of this man.

This is Superman, this is DC, thank you Gunn for sparking the little kid and reminding me of happiness and hope! Anyone who complains that this is not Superman and Henry Cavil is, is just mistakenly wrong.

"Is this a bad comedy The first thing that bothers me is, except for Superman. The casting is bad. The actors don't fit the roles. Then the dialogues are weak, but really. Then there's when monsters the size of a skyscraper go on a rampage and people just watch and eat ice cream! And the story is also weak. For example, there's Superman's secret residence. Which is actually from a much more advanced civilization. They break in and Superman doesn't get any notice!!! Plus they just translate a completely foreign language! Oh and because the experts said that then the recording is original everyone starts to hate Superman. 12",superman secret residence is actually from much more advanced civilization they break in and superman doe not get any notice plus they just translate completely foreign language oh and because the expert said that then the recording is original everyone start to hate superman,The first thing that bother me is except for superman the casting is bad the actor do not fit the role then the dialogue are weak but really then there is when monster the size of skyscraper go on rampage and people just watch and,The first thing that bother me is except for superman the casting is bad the actor do not fit the role then the dialogue are weak but really then there is when monster the size of skyscraper go on rampage and people just watch and eat ice cream,is this bad comedy the first thing that bother me is except for superman the casting is bad the actor do not fit the role then the dialogue are weak but really then there is when monster the size of skyscraper go on rampage and people just
"A hopeful and heartfelt Superman movie I really enjoyed this movie. James Gunn brought back the heart and hope that Superman is all about. It's honest, uplifting, and feels true to the character we know from the comics. Please don't compare it to Man of Steel. Just take it for what it is, a fresh new Superman era. What I loved most is how it makes you feel good. It's not trying to be dark or super serious all the time it's just about a guy trying to do the right thing and bring hope to people. That's what Superman is. It felt genuine, and you can tell it was made with love for the character. If it's not your style, that's okay but no need to hate on it.

Painful powerlessness of the new superman So they couldn't accept that Calvell was perfect for the role. That Superman was godlike and satisfied a hunger for something perfect and on a different league to limitations. This one rejects this notion and downgrades Superman down to a man barely super. It hurt my stomach wanting him to just get one good punch. Something super for gods sake. But nothing came. Just constant human struggle that you can feed on in every other human like movie. Gone is the Superman and replaced with another human. Because humanity will always carry her jealousy hand in hand with her masks and hopes and lies. Hope one day a real Superman returns. 3,calvell wa perfect for the role that superman wa godlike and satisfied hunger for something perfect and on different league to limitation this one reject this notion and downgrade superman down to man barely super it hurt my stomach wanting him to just,"""I wanted him to just get one good punch something super for god sake but nothing came just constant human struggle that you can feed on in every other human like movie gone is the superman and replaced with another human because humanity will always carry",It hurt my stomach wanting him to just get one good punch something super for god sake but nothing came just constant human struggle that you can feed on in every other human like movie gone is the superman and replaced with another human because humanity will always,painful powerlessness of the new superman so they could not accept that calvell wa perfect for the role that superman wa godlike and satisfied hunger for something perfect and on different league to limitation this one reject this notion and downgrade superman
"A Superman for you and your dog! Saw the new Superman film and loved it. The cast was spot on. The production value is what we were hoping for. James Gunn, the cast, the set designers, digital artists and more all excelled at delivering what we all really need: a kickass film to remind us that our humanity is the drive to root out toxicity in all of its form. We all have a role to play - large or small - cape or not - in showing up for each other. I was appreciative that Superman's compassion extended to animals, humans, strangers, robots and even his adversaries. The movie was packed with action and humor.

"A Disappointing Flight for the Man of Steel The latest installment in the Superman saga, while highly anticipated, ultimately falls flat, proving to be an absolute total disappointment. Despite the iconic character's enduring legacy, this film struggles to find its footing, leaving audiences with a sense of unfulfilled potential. The standout performance, by far, comes from Lex Luthor. The actor portraying him delivers a captivating and nuanced portrayal, easily stealing every scene he's in. His interpretation of the classic villain is a definite highlight, offering a glimpse of the brilliance this movie could have achieved. Unfortunately, the strengths end there. The screenplay and script are noticeably subpar, failing to provide a compelling narrative or sharp dialogue. The pacing often feels disjointed, and key character developments feel rushed or underdeveloped. It's a script that doesn't do justice to the rich lore of Superman or the talented cast. Speaking of the cast, David Corenswet, as the new Man of Steel, certainly has the ""greasy cast"" look, embodying the physical presence of Superman. However, he is severely let down by the lack of a supporting script to truly showcase his ability. He's given little to work with beyond the surface, preventing him from delivering a memorable or impactful performance. The potential is there, but the material simply doesn't allow it to shine. In conclusion, while Lex Luthor's performance is a beacon of excellence, the new Superman movie is largely marred by a weak script and a failure to fully utilize its protagonist. It's a missed opportunity that leaves fans yearning for a more heroic cinematic experience. 4",lex luthor portrays the new man of steel in the latest installment in the superman saga . despite the iconic character enduring legacy this film struggle to find it footing leaving audience with sense of unful,The latest installment in the superman saga while highly anticipated ultimately fall flat proving to be an absolute total disappointment.

"What the hell did I just watch? Thankfully it was free to watch on HBO because had I paid to see Superman in theaters, I'd be livid. DC does not know how to develop superhero movies other than Batman, which is surprising. I have no problem with the updated Superman/Clark Kent, at least not really, however just about everything else was a fail. How did they make a 2 hour movie with just about zero character development? Why was the plot hard to follow? Why were the shots from scene to scene so scattered? Why was the justice gang so corny and cheap looking? Why was the movie so cheap looking? There are literally no redeeming qualities about this movie and it's sad, because I/many of us, have watched these movies and tv shows since childhood and DC has turned it into a laughing stock.

"A Shallow Reboot for the Man of Steel - Superboy in a Superman Costume? Honestly, I came into this movie with high hopes. A new take on Superman directed by James Gunn sounded like a promising start for the new DC universe. But after watching it, I left the theater feeling underwhelmed. To put it simply, the movie felt cheesy. The plot had no real depth. Gunn's Superman didn't feel like the iconic character we're used to. He felt more like a teenage, overly nice ""Superboy"" just trying to please everyone. He was saving people left and right, but not in a way that felt inspiring. More like he was desperate for approval. Compared to Henry Cavill's Superman, this version had no weight, no presence, no real character. Lex Luthor's hatred toward Superman also felt forced. There was no build-up, no emotional core behind it. Just pure villain mode with no explanation. And Lois Lane? The chemistry between her and Clark was almost non-existent. They kiss a couple of times and argue a bit, but nothing about their relationship felt convincing. At one point, Lois wants to break up with Clark, but that plot thread goes absolutely nowhere. Suddenly she's risking her life for him. It just didn't add up. Even the supporting cast didn't do much for me. Nathan Fillion is hilarious and usually a scene-stealer, but even his Guy Gardner couldn't save things. And Hawkgirl? That hawk scream was just unbearable. Loud, annoying, and way too frequent. It completely broke the immersion for me. I'll admit, the action scenes were well done. They looked great. But let's be real, it's 2025. That's the bare minimum for a superhero movie now. The post-credit scenes were completely forgettable. They felt like filler, not exciting setups for what's next. Overall, this Superman reboot felt like it was trying too hard to be light and hopeful, but ended up being shallow and unconvincing. It had the heart in the right place maybe, but no soul behind it. More like a flashy Bollywood-style take on Superman with none of the weight that makes the character timeless. Final verdict: Meh. Some cool fights, but no substance. 5",superman reboot felt like it wa trying too hard to be light and hopeful but ended up being shallow and unconvincing it had the heart in the right place maybe but no soul behind it more like flashy bollywood style take on super,"""I came into this movie with high hope new take on superman directed by james gunn sounded like promising start for the new dc universe but after watching it left the theater feeling underwhelmed"" ""The movie felt cheesy the plot",This superman reboot felt like it wa trying too hard to be light and hopeful but ended up being shallow and unconvincing .<n>The supporting cast did not do much for me nathan fillion is hilarious and usually scene stealer but even his,shallow reboot for the man of steel superboy in superman costume honestly came into this movie with high hope new take on superman directed by james gunn sounded like promising start for the new dc universe but after watching it left the theater
"A bit overhyped SPOILER Love superman, best superhero ever 'lived'. First trailer got me excited. But, and there is a big but, the movie itself was not that great. It was like an episode of the show flash or arrow or something like that. Ok to watch, but definitly aiming for younger public. 1. The underwear on the pants is really stupid. I mean, before Snyders superman I didn't know better. But after seeing that suit, how can you go back. 2. Henry Cavil and Brando Routh where so much more suited and better as superman. 3. Liked Lois charachter, well casted. Also mr. Terrific, which is the most interessing charachter, very good. 4. Lantern isn't used enough, has potential. 5. Hawk girl and the Kent parents very forgettable. The parents where so wrong casted. 6. The dog is fun. 7. Lex is a good cast. Played his rol very good. 8. Superman himself is bit of loser, and superman can't be a loser. I really don't get the 'he must have a weak side'. No he doesnt. He's superman. 9. Supergirl at the end....wel let me say this: it didnt get me excited at all, not even a little. 10. There where defenitly good parts/scene like the mr. Terrific fight scene. But mostly childish. 11. The explenation about the hypno glases....why? Everyone has accepted that nobody know Clark Kent is superman just because he puts on glasses. Did I regret going to the cinema? Not really, but seeing I can say it would have been just fine seeing this one at home on the tv. 108",superman best superhero ever lived first trailer got me excited but the movie itself wa not that great it wa like an episode of the show flash or arrow or something like that ok to watch . henry cavil and brando ,The movie itself wa not that great it wa like an episode of the show flash or arrow or something like that ok to watch but definitly aiming for younger public the underwear on the pant is really stupid mean before snyders superman,The underwear on the pant is really stupid mean before snyders superman did not know better .<n>After seeing that suit how can you go back henry cavil and brando routh where so much more suited and better super,bit overhyped spoiler love superman best superhero ever lived first trailer got me excited but and there is big but the movie itself wa not that great it wa like an episode of the show flash or arrow or something like that ok to watch but

"Should never watch the trailers I was so stupid to keep up the trailers. No more surprises when see the whole movie eventually. Well, I don't love this Gunn's Superman, I just like it. Good to have Corenswet as Superman. The figure, etc. My Superman is still Reeve, then Routh kind of taking the heritage better. Nothing that special from this one. the movie it made me pray like ""don't flop, just don't flop, come on, please"" because starting Superman again is so tough, I know that well. People like think and question, ""ok another Superman? How it'll be started?"" The big test is definitely replying the question with of course an extraordinary script and executed by a superb cinematography, just good is not enough. Mr. Gunn please learn & reflect, the sequel would be definitely a free fight zone for you to be super dynamic in script. Now what i don't like and mind about: 1. The costume. 2. The Justice Gang. 3. The easily people turned againts Superman (when Spiderman was libelled by Mysterio was way better displaying the conflict). 0",superman is still reeve then routh kind of taking the heritage better nothing that special from this one the movie it made me pray like do not flop just don't flop come on please because starting superman again is,"""I love this gunn superman just like it good to have corenswet superman the figure etc my superman is still reeve then routh kind of taking the heritage better nothing that special from this one the movie it",should never watch the trailer wa so stupid to keep up the trailer no more surprise when see the whole movie eventually well do not love this gunn superman .<n>My superman is still reeve then routh kind of taking the,should never watch the trailer wa so stupid to keep up the trailer no more surprise when see the whole movie eventually well do not love this gunn superman just like it good to have corenswet superman the figure etc my superman
"Captures to essense of Superman This is what a good heartfelt superman movie feels like.

Watch this movie, if you haven't, it's a great time, low ratings are from butt hurt snyderverse toxic fans, that just can't let things go.. glad the mopey, oh this is so edgy era of DC movies is over.. Krypto is fun, so is Nathan Fillion as Guy Gardner,I can't wait to see what James Gunn does next with this universe. This is a great reboot.

"Mixed feelings I thought the actors did phenomenal, as well as the cinematography and special effects. My opinion is more based on the direction the movie went. Some characters felt too off of who they are known to be, and one has a short appearance that I feel like puts the character in a negative image that I never imagined her to be in. Also, some of the humor fell flat for me personally. The action scenes didnt feel big enough and overall the movie ended and I was hoping for something a bit different from a superman movie. Debated on a rating with myself. Started at 5, bumped to a 6 due to how great the actors did. I would say its worth a watch but could be better. 1",the actor did phenomenal well the cinematography and special effect my opinion is more based on the direction the movie went some character felt too off of who they are known to be and one ha short appearance that feel like put the character in negative image,Some character felt too off of who they are known to be and one ha short appearance that feel like put the character in negative image that never imagined her to be in.

"This is the worst super hero movie I've ever seen. It's as if the director gave 90% of the movie to the special effects guys, and those guys have no clue of how to make a good film, or even a so-so film. It's been over an hour since I left the theater, and I finally had to an aspirin to relieve the headache this movie gave me. Here's the good: the guy who played Superman did his best, and was generally excellent. Rachel Brosnahan was also awfully good, and the dog was cute at first, but grew tiresome as he did the same damn thing over and over again. There have been many Superman films over the years, some good and some bad, but this one definitely takes the cake as the very worst. 3",this is the worst super hero movie have ever seen it is if the director gave of the movie to the special effect guy and those guy have no clue of how to make good film or so so film it is been over an hour since leaving,This is the worst super hero movie have ever seen it is if the director gave of the movie to the special effect guy and those guy have no clue of how to make good film or even so so film it is been over an hour since,this is the worst super hero movie have ever seen it is if the director gave of the movie to the special effect guy and those guy have no clue of how to make good film or even so so so film it is been over an hour since,this is the worst super hero movie have ever seen it is if the director gave of the movie to the special effect guy and those guy have no clue of how to make good film or even so so film it is been over an hour since left
"Something missing SPOILER I'm not sure how I feel about this film in all honesty. I think it's no doubt a ""good"" film, however it's difficult to place my finger on what it is about the film which left me thinking, ""is that it?"". It could be because it lacked any sort of stakes which made the threat feel imminent, or it could be because the tone overall was not serious, it made any threat presented in the film not be taken seriously. It's difficult to say, and while it was a good film, it wasn't ""epic"". I'm not a massive fan of Snyder, I think there's plenty he got wrong, but there are also many things he got right. The superman in Man Of Steel felt truly powerful and otherworldly where you can feel his power and strength, and see him as an alien. Perhaps Snyder did lean too much in that direction, however, Gunn went the opposite way and presented him as too human to the extent that he felt like a man with powers rather than an alien from Krypton. Furthermore, he made Superman human by making his parents seem cruel and evil, and this is something that I fundamentally disagree with. His biological parents were not evil, and nor did they want him to rule over earth. This does pose a challenge for how Gunn will make Kal El interact with his father's hologram in the future. The soundtrack wasn't amazing but there were some key tracks which were great. I think James Gunn played it very safe, even the most diehard fans should concede this. It was a safe film which I found entertaining, however the pacing was weak and the story too, but it did the job of introducing the universe and I do want to see where he takes it. 1",the soundtrack wa not amazing but there were some key track which were great think james gunn played it very safe . but it did the job of introducing the universe and do want to see where he takes it .,"""Man of steel"" is a good film but not epic.

"Dooperman I thought it was a fun summer movie that sacrificed a great start to the franchise for a campy, slapstick movie. Let be clear between Kyrpto, Lex, and some humor elements, the movie was clear success. I just believe it was a missed opportunity. I did however enjoy the new cinematic characters. What many seem to forget about movies like winter soldier, civil war, end game etc., they were dark and serious, AND fun. Superman sold out for laughs and think the film suffered due to that fact. The film was less superman and more teen titans. I couldn't imagine a universe such as this with batman! And that is a travesty. 1",dooperman thought it wa fun summer movie that sacrificed great start to the franchise for campy slapstick movie let be clear between kyrpto lex and some humor element the movie wa clear success just believe it wa,Dooperman thought it wa fun summer movie that sacrificed great start to the franchise for campy slapstick movie let be clear between kyrpto lex and some humor element the movie wa clear success just believe it wa missed opportunity did however,dooperman thought it wa fun summer movie that sacrificed great start to the franchise for campy slapstick movie let be clear between kyrpto lex and some humor element the movie wa clear success just believe it wa missed opportunity did however enjoy the,dooperman thought it wa fun summer movie that sacrificed great start to the franchise for campy slapstick movie let be clear between kyrpto lex and some humor element the movie wa clear success just believe it wa missed opportunity did however enjoy
"""Up Up and A failure"" After years of anticipation, the 2025 iteration of Superman has finally landed, and unfortunately, it crashes and burns faster than a Kryptonian spaceship without its guidance system. Touted as a fresh take on the Man of Steel, this film instead delivers a muddled narrative, uninspired action, and a portrayal of its iconic hero that feels shockingly hollow. From the outset, the film struggles with its identity. Is it a gritty reboot? A lighthearted adventure? A character study? It tries to be all of these things and, in doing so, becomes none of them effectively. The pacing is erratic, lurching from slow, exposition-heavy scenes to rushed, incoherent action sequences that leave you more confused than thrilled. The biggest sin, however, lies in its depiction of Superman himself. The new actor, while physically imposing, delivers a performance that lacks the inherent warmth, hope, and moral fortitude that defines the character. This Superman feels distant, almost apathetic, and his struggles come across as whiny rather than genuinely conflicted. His interactions with Lois Lane, often the heart of Superman stories, are devoid of chemistry, reducing their legendary romance to a series of awkward exchanges. The villain, a generic, CGI-heavy threat whose motivations are as clear as a mud puddle, offers no real challenge or intrigue. Their grand plan is vaguely destructive, and their inevitable defeat feels less like a triumph for our hero and more like a foregone conclusion that simply takes too long to arrive. The special effects, surprisingly, are a mixed bag. While some shots of Metropolis are visually impressive, many of the action sequences suffer from an over-reliance on weightless CGI, making the destruction feel more like a video game cutscene than a cinematic event. Even the score, usually a soaring highlight in Superman films, is forgettable, failing to evoke any sense of grandeur or emotion. It's as if the filmmakers were so preoccupied with ""deconstructing"" the hero that they forgot to make a compelling movie. ""Superman (2025)"" is a missed opportunity of epic proportions. It takes one of the most beloved characters in fiction and strips him of his essence, leaving behind a bland, unengaging spectacle. Fans hoping for a return to form for the Last Son of Krypton will likely leave the cinema feeling more disappointed than inspired. Here's hoping the next attempt can actually fly. 164",the film struggle with it identity is it gritty reboot lighthearted adventure character study it try to be all of these things effectively the pacing is erratic lurching from slow exposition heavy scene to rushed incoherent,The film struggle with it identity is it gritty reboot lighthearted adventure character study it try to be all of these thing and in doing so becomes none of them effectively the pacing is erratic lurching from slow exposition heavy scene to rushed incoherent,This iteration of superman ha finally landed and unfortunately it crash and burn faster than kryptonian spaceship .<n>The film struggle with it identity is it gritty reboot lighthearted adventure character study it try to be all of these thing .<n>The,up up and failure after year of anticipation the iteration of superman ha finally landed and unfortunately it crash and burn faster than kryptonian spaceship without it guidance system touted fresh take on the man of steel this film instead delivers muddled narrative uninspired
"Best Superman film in decades I'm so glad we finally got a Superman movie that actually feels like a Superman movie. This movie actually does justice to the characters, including Lex Luthor, Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen. But Superman himself actually felt like a symbol of hope. David Corenswet really nailed it in the role. He's got all the charisma and campy do-goodiness that Superman is known for. It's just an action-packed thrill ride from start to finish, and really feels like you're reading a comic or watching the cartoon. Granted, the transitions to some of the action sequences could've been a bit smoother, and the movie throws you in the middle of the action seemingly out of nowhere, even early on. But it works, and the enemies are genuinely menacing and sick looking. It looked so cool for Superman to be taking them down. On top of that, there were a few somewhat ridiculous moments here and there, but they were small and not too distracting. Plus Nicholas Hoult's Lex Luthor was the best we've seen in ages. Leaps and bounds better than that terrible Jesse Eisenberg portrayal. I mean it's not even close. He actually felt like a conniving, unstable madman, and was genuinely menacing as a villain. Something we haven't seen from Luthor in a long long time. Overall a solid start to the DCU, and already leagues better than the start to the DCEU. Can't wait to see what Gunn & Co have in store next. 1",superman movie really doe justice to the character including lex luthor lois lane and jimmy olsen . the movie throw you in the middle of the action seemingly out of nowhere even early,Superman is just an action packed thrill ride from start to finish and really feel like you are reading comic or watching the cartoon.

"In James Gunn We Trust James Gunn might be my favorite writer/director/producer in the industry right now. He knows exactly what needs to be done in order to create emotional investment in characters, while still entertaining the larger audience. With that in mind, I think that Superman is an excellent start to the new DCU. The casting is excellent, the score slaps and I'm eagerly waiting to see these characters again on the big screen. My biggest gripes with this film are the Justice Gang and the lack of Clark Kent moments. 1. The Justice Gang. While I enjoyed their scenes, specifically those involving Mr. Terrific, I think that their introduction would have been better in a Superman sequel. At times, they distracted from the story I wanted to watch. 2. We needed a little more Clark Kent. There is honestly only a handful of scenes with Superman out of costume and I needed a bit more of that. Whether it was with Lois, Ma and Pa Kent or the crew at the Daily Planet, I just needed a little more. Small gripes aside, I found a lot of joy while watching this film. There is a brightness to this version of Superman, both physically and emotionally. I'm stoked for what is to come.

"Pretty Good Movie Rating - 7.7: Overall, a pretty good superhero movie that lays the foundation for James Gunn's DCU and David Corenswet's Superman; the former uses his traditional quirky and humorous interjection style, which he was known for with Guardians of the Galaxy, to make an entertaining movie, and the latter has the charisma and character to fill the suit; while I do commend them for taking such a big risk talking about real world issues in their biggest property, it does so in such an on-the-nose and shallow way that it makes the audience feel dumb. Direction - Good: The direction on a macro scale feels very James Gunn, as this movie feels very similar to Guardians of the Galaxy; The direction on a micro scale feels similar to Guardians of the Galaxy, but is still profound in getting the most out of the actors in the more dramatic moments; The storytelling is very similar to Guardians of the Galaxy, but is a little too simple and overt for the audience; They build tension in a way similar to other superhero movies Story - Pretty Good: The concept is Superman at his lowest as he is learning he is not as invincible as he thinks he is, which is a bold strategy to start your Superman on; I do admit it is very commendable for them to use their biggest property to tackle real-world issues, but it was a little too on-the-nose and shallow that it kind of just makes the audience feel dumb when they talk about these things; The plot structure is pretty linear and traditional to other Gunn movies; Character writing is surprisingly good as they build moral compasses for all these characters that superhero movies really shy away from, and this makes you actually care about them and want to see what happens next Screenplay - Pretty Good: The dialogue is very James Gunn, quirky and filled with humor, but it does have its profound moments; The humor is very traditional to James Gunn; The symbolism is honestly a little too on-the-nose and shallow, as it is not subtle at all what these conflicts are supposed to mirror in the real world, but them discussing morality and duty is pretty good; The foreshadowing is decent Acting - Pretty Good to Good: David Corenswet - Good (He has the charisma and character to fill the suit, as he really embodies the role; He has good chemistry with Brosnahan; Side note, this dude just seems like a really chill guy that I would want to hang out with), Rachel Brosnahan - Good (Plays Lois Lane very well as she is smart and independent, yet a strong love interest to Kent, led by the good chemistry she has with Corenswet), Nicholas Hoult - Pretty Good to Good (Plays Lex Luthor well, as casting someone who lost the part of Superman was a genius move; A little over the top, but it is pretty obvious this role is supposed to emulate Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, even though that is just who Lex Luthor really is), Edi Gathegi - Pretty Good (Basically the typical comedic relief character you see in James Gunn movies), Anthony Carrigan - Pretty Good (Plays his role well), Nathan Fillion - Pretty Good to Good (A comedic relief character that is traditional to Gunn movies, but I enjoyed the banter he had with Superman throughout the movie), Isabela Merced - Pretty Good (Really was not used well, but I enjoyed her presence and wish to see more of her in future DCU movies), Rest of the cast - Pretty Good (Everyone feels like their role is carved out by Gunn because they all help tell this quirky, comedic superhero movie that the director is known for) Score - Good: Interpolates the original John Williams themes throughout the movie and modernizes them to create a modern Superman Soundtrack - Good: Feels very James Gunn curated, so good Cinematography - Bad: I honestly hated the cinematography for this movie because it was just way too close to the subjects and was nauseating at times; If you are shooting in IMAX, please effectively use your mise-en-scène and not just make every image just Superman Editing - Pretty Good: Nothing really special is better than the cinematography Sound - Good: Strong, as what you would expect from a superhero movie Visual Effects - Good to Very Good: Not too over-the-top, and helps complement this world and what is out of this world; Did we really need to CGI the dog throughout the entire movie Production Design - Pretty Good to Good: Took a bit of getting used to as most of this world is definitely CGI, but it is fine in helping create Metropolis and the Fortress of Solitude Makeup - Good: Helps create what is out of this world and makes Superman look rugged and prone to being hurt Costumes - Good to Very Good: Feels like an homage to old Superman iterations and older DC properties Pacing - Pacing felt about right as the movie did not feel too slow or fast; the humor definitely helped make the movie not drag Climax - Climax is definitely meant to be a spectacle, and it was an enjoyable action sequence, even though it is a little too safe and predictable Tone - Tone is very similar to James Gunn's other superhero movies, as there are many quirky and funny interjections throughout the movie to make it feel playful Final Notes - Watched at AMC Lincoln Square in IMAX; 1",james gunn dcu and david corenswet superman the former us his traditional quirky and humorous interjection style which he wa known for with guardian of the galaxy to make an entertaining movie . the,"""Superman"" is a superhero movie that lay the foundation for james gunn dcu and david corenswet superman.

Awful Truly awful. Aimed squarely at not only children but immature young adults with no cohesive structure. Let's do this and this and this and.......... it just doesn't work. This is what DC and Superman look like when it's 100% done Marvel style. James Gunn thinks he's taken over and is going to revolutionise cinema with his fresh take on........ yeah he hasn't. With plot elements stolen from every previous Superman movie including bits and pieces from CWs Smallville it's all over the place. It felt like a SNL parody and hoped that things would improve but they didn't. Rebooting something is one thing but rewriting well establish Superman lore with regards to Jor-El and Lara's intentions for him just because James Gunn wanted to us just sacrilege. Let's hope this new universe implodes and is done with quicker than the Universal's Dark Universe. 14,marvel style james gunn thinks he is taken over and is going to revolutionise cinema with his fresh take on yeah he hasn with plot element stolen from every previous superman movie including bit and piece from cw,"""awful truly awful aimed squarely at not only child but immature young adult with no cohesive structure"" ""Plot element stolen from every previous superman movie including bit and piece from cws smallville it is all over the place it felt like",This is what dc and superman look like when it is done marvel style james gunn think he is taken over and is going to revolutionise cinema with his fresh take .<n>It is all over the place it felt like snl parody,awful truly awful aimed squarely at not only child but immature young adult with no cohesive structure let do this and this and this and it just doe not work this is what dc and superman look like when it is done marvel style james
"There we go SPOILER A lovely film. Not a perfect film, but a lovely film. James Gunn mostly nails this perfectly cast Superman film by making the best decision any filmmaker has ever made: Basing the script on the actual comics this character came from. It's ludicrous that this is the 4th big screen iteration of the man of steel and this is the first time the film was made by someone who read a comic or genuinely likes this character. The pocket dimension CGI was shonky, yes, the Ultraman reveal and look was... not my favorite? But oh boy am I happy to be a DC fan for the first time in a long time. And the introduction of Supergirl makes me really excited for her movie. David Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahan nailed it. I hope in the sequel everyone in this cast gets more time to dig in because they're really good. Especially Nicholas Hoult. So evil. And weird, which I loved. His hate spewing monkeys were a wonderful touch. Thank you, thank you. But also maybe have less CGI heavy sequences next time.

"The Beginning of DC's New Era You know, it has been quite a while now since we actually got a good Superman movie since Man of Steel. The 2025 Superman movie is a very enjoyable superhero movie that tells a very solid tale of what happens if he loses even one battle against a threat. I won't say it's as great as the original 1978 film, but I definitely consider this as one of the best Superman films with a nice story that twists on what happens if Lex wins a battle, great visuals, intense action, solid characters, fantastic acting, and an inspiring commentary against war. This is the movie I think any superhero fan is going to have a good time with. This the Superman movie anyone would want, as a brand new story. I'm glad that DC Universe got rebooted. Because with that, we can actually get good films. DC Extended Universe was mixed where sometimes they've made good movies, and sometimes they've made bad movies. In fact, with this film, I believe that this is off to a solid start. 3",superman movie tell very solid story of what happens if lex win battle great visuals intense action solid character fantastic acting and an inspiring commentary against war this is the movie think any superhero fan is going to have good time with this the superman,Superman movie is very enjoyable superhero movie that tell very solid tale of what happens if he loses even one battle against threat.

"Better Than Expected SPOILER Have to say I wasn't expecting much going into this film. I was pleasantly surprised. Alot of Action and comedy in it .Perhaps more importantly, it had plenty of bright colours in the scenes, something lacking in the DC universe of films. It's has its fair share of flaws too. The two 'Middle-Eastern' countires warfare was a bit too much and political. Could have wrote a better background conflict. What was the point of the big armoured meta-human who beat superman at the start. Only to have the armoured suit never appear again?? Plus the ending with Lex Luthor was rushed and shallow. In saying that, the Superman character was top shelve and Lex Luthor was one of the best portrayals of the character ever. Super Dog was a nice little addiction. The Justice Gang was a good support group. I'd watch the movie again and check out a sequel too.

"Superman succeeds in its cinematic hope! Superman is a bold, heartfelt reboot that puts kindness front and center. It succeeds in its cinematic hope! James Gunn delivers a Superman who feels needed in today's world and a symbol of clarity, heroism, and optimism. I'm still smiling just thinking about it! This movie has some standout lead performances, a charismatic villain, and that adorable Krypto. Gunn's signature bright visuals pleasure with bold and bright colors. A movie truly made for IMAX. Some CGI sequences, especially in major battle scenes, have uneven quality, while others are visually striking. James Gunn delivers a superhero movie with strong performances and just the right touch of humor. Despite some flawless CGI moments, it's a refreshing return to heroism with soul and heart! I recommend this big time! 11",superman succeeds in it cinematic hope superman is bold heartfelt reboot that put kindness front and center . james gunn delivers superman who feel needed in today world and symbol of clarity heroism and optimism ,Superman is bold heartfelt reboot that put kindness front and center it succeeds in it cinematic hope james gunn delivers superman who feel needed in today world and symbol of clarity heroism and optimism am still smiling just thinking about it this movie ha,superman succeeds in it cinematic hope superman is bold heartfelt reboot that put kindness front and center it succeeds in it cinematic hope james gunn delivers superman who feel needed in today world and symbol of clarity of heroism and optimism am still smiling just,superman succeeds in it cinematic hope superman is bold heartfelt reboot that put kindness front and center it succeeds in it cinematic hope james gunn delivers superman who feel needed in today world and symbol of clarity heroism and optimism am still smiling just
"Super-Meh Im a huge fan of DC characters, even more so than Marvel, but when it comes to their characterization in live action movies, they have been awful. I would just like to start off by saying this is a way better movie than anything Snyder ever did, Snyders version of superman is like bad fan fiction. And I was so happy to hear James Gunn was taking over and had high hope for this one, but it just flat lined, hard. Superman although more humanized in this version, he does not feel like a super man, completely beatable, weak, and depended too much on the sun for his powers. Which I know is canonically correct but definitely overused in this. I actually dont mind the idea of starting out in the middle, as in no origin story, but if you go that route it should still feel like somewhat an introduction for these characters and this world. Instead it feels like a sequel or a threequel and not a good one. The problem is this movie just felt over crammed with too many story threads, side characters, and comedy relief moments. Unfortunately Gunn brought too much of that *insert joke here*, when things gets too serious, that marvel loves so much. For the positives, I do love the actors that portrayed the characters, they each do a great job filling these roles. I went to see this with a group of friends, and almost all of us had the same issues with it, and agreed that we'd probably never even watch it again, unfortunately that doesnt give me high hopes for the future of DC, but I hope Gunn brings in some writers to help, and can course correct before its too late. 56",super meh im huge fan of dc character even more so than marvel . but when it comes to their characterization they have been awful would just like to start off by saying this is way better than anything snyder ever,"""This is way better movie than anything snyder ever did snyders version of superman is like bad fan fiction"" ""This movie just felt over crammed with too many story thread side character and comedy relief moment unfortunately gunn brought",This is way better movie than anything snyder ever did snyders version of superman is like bad fan fiction .<n>This movie just felt over crammed with too many story thread side character and comedy relief moment .<n>,super meh im huge fan of dc character even more so than marvel but when it come to their characterization in live action movie they have been awful would just like to start off by saying this is way better movie than anything snyder ever did
"Solid film overall SPOILER Let me preface this review by saying I'm not the biggest Superman fan. The only movie I've ever seen was Man of Steel, which I thought had potential but missed the mark overall in my opinion. The biggest positive I can say about this movie is the cast. I thought everyone was great, especially David Corneswet as Superman. He fully embodies the role and made me care for the character in ways I never did. Nicholas Hoult was also great, just wish they gave Lexi Luthor more screen time. Now to my negatives, slight spoilers ahead. The writing felt really weak at times through the movie, in particular during the second act, and things seemed to happen just out of plot convenience. The selfie girl who was Lex's GF was completely unnecessary and was only in for comedic purposes, except it was annoying the entire time and never funny. But actually she did have a purpose, and it was so Lois can find out where Superman was taken to. Very cheap convenient writing and I really did not like that part. When they're in the pocket dimension, it was entirely stupid for Lex to put Superman in that cage with Metamorpho. And what do you know, he helps Superman escape. Shocker. Stuff like that I can't stand because it completely undercuts the character of Lex, who's being portrayed as this evil super genius, and yet he's stupid enough to believe that his plan would've held Superman in check? Stupid writing imo. The entire plot line of the pocket dimension just seemed so unnecessary and was done to set up another conflict for Superman to solve, which is dumb because they have the entire storyline of the potential war between those two countries, and in the 3rd act that gets out on the back burner so Superman can stop Metropolis and the world from being ripped in half and destroyed. For the first movie into the new DCU it just felt unnecessary stakes, and the stakes didn't really hit given that the entire world was potential going to end. Wish they kept it more grounded and focused on the characters more. Overall that's the film's biggest problem imo, they throw you into this world where everything is established and you're just meant to keep up. Batman v Superman did a similar thing and it didn't work at all, while this movie definitely is better than that one, I think it still suffers from the same problems for being oversaturated. Still excited for the future of the DCU, but this wasn't exactly what I was hoping for with the first movie in this new universe. 1",nicholas hoult wa also great just wish they gave lexi luthor more screen time . superman wa is stupid enough to believe that his plan would have held superman in check stupid writing imo,The writing felt really weak at time through the movie in particular during the second act and thing seemed to happen just out of plot convenience the selfie girl who wa lex gf wa completely unnecessary.

"One of the greatest superhero movies of all time I'm a big comic book fan and a big superhero fan, of course. I knew this movie would be great and boy it did not disappoint. The chemistry between David and Rachel was really good and they have great performances. Nicholas as Lex was incredible, too. The humor was pretty good as well. Definitely not an all-out comedy but it was did work pretty well. I never write reviews for movies but I had to for this one. I'm absolutely stoked to see what's next for the DCU and it's off to a great start already. I absolutely loved this movie and I highly recommend it. If I could give this an I would.

"Disappointing and very boring SPOILER I went into this movie with decent hope. I have never been a fan of James Gunn's work even when he was at Marvel. I hoped this movie would be good (since The Flash movie was really good), but it was soo boring. Every minute felt like 10, and this movie is 2 hrs 10 mins long. The camera angles were terrible, why were the shots of Superman flying shot so close to his face?? I've never seen such angles until this movie. Every time you saw Superman flying, it looked ridiculous, why shoot those shots from that up close?? The CGI was so bad as well, you could tell the dog was not real. It also seemed like they didn't know how certain things would look until maybe post production, because when Superman is being carried by the robots, his legs are strangely really far apart, like they didn't know where he or the robots would be. Also, when he is captured by the bad guys, he's walking down the steps and his legs are again super far apart for no reason. The comedy is so bad and corny. I felt like I was watching a Marvel movie with the bad CGI and bad jokes. The movie itself was bad to me. The story itself was just all over the place. Superman didn't win a single fight without some type of help. I understand that he can't win everything, but he is the Man of Steel, he was taking L after L. I wasn't rooting for any character after a certain point. The Justice Gang was also randomly introduced halfway into the movie?? And they all were pretty bad characters that I did not care for. I have always been a fan of Clark Kent and Lois' relationship, but wait you don't see any of it in this movie. They get introduced already being 3 months into their relationship, then they're in a fight in which Lois says she wanted to dump him, then in the end they make up with their I love yous. Their relationship just did not feel very developed to me. If this were anyone's introduction to Superman, you wouldn't understand anything about him. Who is Superman? What is he doing this for? He seems like he doesn't know who he is. There is a scene where he is around Kryptonite and is weak, but they don't explain it. Good thing most viewers have seen Superman and know it's his weakness, because how would anyone know. He also saves a woman from a building collapsing, but great job everyone behind her died. But since the camera only focuses on that one woman, he seems like a big hero. I also don't understand how the people in the movie also don't like him for most of the movie, then just randomly start liking him again. Lex Luthor is angry, but the movie doesn't explain why he is angry. What is all this for? Some villains are just evil, but the movie doesn't even explain that. Things just happen in this movie to happen. The only reason I gave this move higher than one star is because some of the effects that the villains do is cool, but you can't really see it because of the camera angles. Nothing in this movie felt very developed, and it is a shame because this movie had potential, but was not well executed. If they had followed more of how The Flash movie was, this movie could've been great. 17",superman is being carried by the robot and his leg are again super far apart for no reason the movie is so bad and corny felt like wa watching marvel movie with the bad cgi and bad joke the movie itself wa bad to me,This movie is soo boring every minute felt like and this movie is hr min long the camera angle were terrible why were the shot of superman flying shot so close to his face have never seen such angle until this movie every time you saw,This movie had potential but wa not well executed if they had followed more of how the flash movie wa this movie could have been great .<n>This movie had potential but wa not well executed if they had followed more of how the flash movie wa,disappointing and very boring spoiler went into this movie with decent hope have never been fan of james gunn work even when he wa at marvel hoped this movie would be good but it wa soo boring every minute felt like and this

"Not a masterpiece, but a damn entertaining Superman movie SPOILER Just got back from watching the new Superman - and honestly, I really enjoyed it. No, it's not some cinematic game-changer, but it's a big step in the right direction for the DC Universe. After years of messy CGI and tone-deaf storytelling, this one actually feels like it has some heart and vision. Let's start with the good: The action scenes are excellent. Heavy, grounded (as grounded as Superman can be), and visually really satisfying. The CGI? Surprisingly great - especially considering how rough DC's effects have been in recent years. And Krypto the Superdog? He absolutely steals the show. He's fun, never annoying, and actually plays a meaningful role in the story. Totally worked for me. David Corenswet as Superman really fits the role. He doesn't come off as some untouchable god - he feels human, hopeful, and just genuinely good. He wants to help everyone, sees the best in people, and carries this real sense of idealism that just feels like Superman. I thought he did a fantastic job embodying that. That said... the movie definitely has its issues. There's a lot going on. Honestly, too much. The plot jumps around like crazy, trying to juggle multiple storylines and characters, which means a lot of stuff ends up underdeveloped. Clark Kent barely exists in this movie - he's on screen maybe twice - and because of that, his relationship with Lois Lane lacks emotional depth. We're told they love each other, but we never really feel it. Also - and this bugged me - Superman gets his ass kicked way too often. I get it, he's still early in his career here, but damn, he gets ragdolled in pretty much every fight. He constantly needs help to win. After a while, it starts to chip away at the Superman mythos a bit. He doesn't feel powerful - he feels like the guy who might win... if backup arrives in time. Lex Luthor was another mixed bag. Nicholas Hoult is great in the role - cold, intelligent, menacing - but the script doesn't fully commit. At first, he's genuinely terrifying (there's a Russian roulette scene that's brutal), but then by the end, he's basically a punchline. Literally. Crypto chews on him like a toy while Superman chuckles. It undercuts the threat he was building up to be. One more thing: the comedy. Sometimes it works. But other times, especially during emotional scenes, it completely undercuts the moment. There's a big plot twist about Superman's parents and his true purpose on Earth - something that should shake him to his core - and instead of letting that emotion breathe, they throw in some jokes about his dog. It's not constant, but it's enough to notice. Despite all that, I really did like the movie. It's flawed, sure - too crowded, a little tonally uneven - but it's way better than most recent DC films, and it actually made me excited about where the new DCU might go. It's not going to be for everyone, but for me? It was fun, surprisingly heartfelt at times, and it left me wanting more. If you're open to a younger, more hopeful, sometimes vulnerable Superman, you'll probably have a good time too. 2",the action scene are excellent heavy grounded and visually really satisfying the cgi surprisingly great . david corenswet superman really fit the role he doe not come off some untouchable god he feel human,Krypto the superdog absolutely steal the show he is fun never annoying and actually play meaningful role in the story totally worked for me.

Disappointed I have been a massive fan of Marvel and DC But this Superman remake was one of the worst I've ever encountered. It's so childish. It's so disappointing and reflects nothing on the Superman franchise. Don't watch it. The storyline was bad. The acting was cheap. Superman was too weak. The production was really bad.

"Perfect popcorn movie Honestly this was better than I was expecting it to be. It was fun, and light hearted and had some surprising life lessons In there. The storyline is simple yet somewhat effective but I guess you don't go and watch superman and expect a story or character development. It's not perfect but it could have Been a lot worse. It was the perfect length also and found myself captivated throughout the whole film and only got slightly bored once, which is suprusing after all the not so great films that have been presented to audiences in the last couple of years Overall worth a watch, just don't expect anything much and you will enjoy it a lot more. 2",perfect popcorn movie honestly this wa better than wa expecting it to be it wa fun and light hearted and had some surprising life lesson in there the storyline is simple yet somewhat effective but guess you do not go and watch superman and expect story or,"""This wa better than wa expecting it to be it wa fun and light hearted and had some surprising life lesson in there the storyline is simple yet somewhat effective but guess you do not go and watch superman and expect story or character development",This wa better than wa expecting it to be it wa fun and light hearted and had some surprising life lesson in there the storyline is simple yet somewhat effective .,perfect popcorn movie honestly this wa better than wa expecting it to be it wa fun and light hearted and had some surprising life lesson in there the storyline is simple yet somewhat effective but guess you do not go and watch superman and expect story or
"Worst superman movie ever saw in my life I watched James Gunn's ""Superman"" with high expectations, but I left feeling totally disappointed. The film is completely soulless; the Superman they present is an empty character, lacking in development, too absurd and with too many tantrums for my taste. The humor they try to inject doesn't work and instead ruins moments that could be emotional or important. I found the plot confusing and repetitive, with a villain who makes no sense because he already has what he wants from the beginning, and there are too many unnecessary twists and turns that cause the story to lose its pace and coherence. In short, I was expecting an epic movie and ended up watching a heartless disaster that fails to capture the essence of the hero we love so much. I don't recommend it for Superman fans or anyone looking for a good superhero movie. 1",james gunn superman with high expectation but left feeling totally disappointed the film is completely soulless the superman they present is an empty character lacking in development too absurd and with too many tantrum for my taste the humor they try to inject,The film is completely soulless the superman they present is an empty character lacking in development too absurd and with too many tantrum for my taste the humor they try to inject doe not work and instead ruin moment that could be emotional,Worst superman movie ever saw in my life watched james gunn superman with high expectation but left feeling totally disappointed the film is completely soulless the superman they present is an empty character lacking in development too absurd and with too many tantrum for,worst superman movie ever saw in my life watched james gunn superman with high expectation but left feeling totally disappointed the film is completely soulless the superman they present is an empty character lacking in development too absurd and with too many

"Restoring faith in the industry I have grown up on superhero movies from marvel to dc and have grown up to fall in love with the comics. Yet in recent years, I have felt that comic book movie have lost the love of the comics they come from and left me feeling disappointed leaving theaters. However, this movie felt like it wasn't abandoning and scorning the comics but felt more like it was applauding them and the movie felt like a Superman comic book issue. Every actor in this movie felt like they really embraced and showed their characters in a truly accurate way. Not to mention the amazing acting but this movie was absolutely hilarious and perfectly met my expectations. The scenery really felt like walking into a comic book like the way we imagined as kids. Hands down and amazing movie and I can't wait to see what DC and James Gunn has in store for projects in the future.

"Truth, Justice and the James Gunn Way SPOILER So far this year, movies have either exceeded my expectations and impressed me, or fallen short and left me wanting more. I didn't expect Superman to fall into neither category. Instead, it landed in a third: exactly what I was looking for. When you go into a James Gunn movie, you're more likely to get a comedy with superheroes than a traditional superhero film-and this is absolutely a James Gunn movie before it's a Superman one. His signature humor is present in almost every scene. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but that's not necessarily a negative. Comedy is one of the hardest things to pull off. Despite the film occasionally feeling cluttered, nearly everything else pays off. If anything, it should've been longer-or even split into two films-because there's just so much going on. Lois Lane is great here. She finally feels like more than just a damsel or plot device. She rises above the 70s version in terms of agency while still feeling more authentically ""Lois"" than Amy Adams' portrayal. That said, the real standouts are Lex Luthor and the Justice Gang. All three members of the Justice Gang land perfectly. I was especially surprised by how much I liked Mr. Terrific. I sincerely hope he becomes a recurring character in the DCU. Edi Gathegi finally gets a role that doesn't waste his talent, unlike his previous superhero outing. Lex Luthor is perfectly petty. He's exactly what I want Reverse-Flash to be: a jealous, vindictive crybaby-and I mean that in the best way possible. I appreciated the film's effort to humanize Superman, though his tantrums sometimes bordered on unintentionally funny. Still, Krypto is a highlight, and the broader DC universe is set up really well. If this film proves anything, it's that DC is finally in the right hands. My main criticisms are a few questionable character choices. Why is Ultraman a clone instead of just using Cyborg Superman? Why does Otis feel so indistinguishable from Luthor's other goons? And why-somehow-does Skyler Gisondo as Jimmy Olsen work so well? Honestly, the Daily Planet scenes stole the movie. As I mentioned earlier, this is more of a James Gunn film than a traditional Superman film-but that's okay. I still had a great time and am genuinely hopeful for the future of the DCU.

And came up with this joke. Fortitude of solitude manned by girl robots? Monkeys on social media? Green lantern? Mini-universe created in space by Lex Luthor where they are holding political prisoners? Lex Luthor's primary objective to become King of a country to control its petroleum reserves?

"""A New Dawn for the Man of Steel"" 🎬 Review by Cinematic Phantom If we look at it from my perspective, the Superman movie isn't exceptionally good or bad - it stands as a balanced and decent beginning for the new DCU. We've grown familiar with the mid-tone and darker aesthetic of Henry Cavill's Superman in Snyder's universe - the brooding presence, the serious tone, the heavy costume. But James Gunn has taken a boldly different approach. His Superman reflects the essence of the comics - a guardian of humanity and nature, not defined by attitude but by empathy and hope. The tone is vibrant, the vibe is colorful, and the simplicity is intentional. Cameos like Peacemaker and the appearance of Supergirl at the end clearly aim to lay the foundation for future storylines, which is a smart move, considering this is the first film of the newly remastered DCU. From that lens, the movie felt tonally balanced. The background score also lived up to the expectations we have from a James Gunn project - thematic, emotional, and well-suited to the character's arc. So overall, I would rate this film a 7 out of 10 - a thoughtful reintroduction that sets the stage for a broader cinematic journey. 0",new dawn for the man of steel review by cinematic phantom if we look at it from my perspective the superman movie is not exceptionally good or bad it stand balanced and decent beginning for the new dcu we have grown familiar,The movie felt tonally balanced the background score also lived up to the expectation we have from james gunn project thematic emotional and well suited to the character arc.

"James Gunn did it again Went in skeptical, fully burned out on superhero movies... but Superman blew me away. Weird, heartfelt, chaotic in the best way. Feels like a real comic book come to life, not just studio slop. Corenswet just is Superman. His scenes with Lois had me grinning like an idiot. Hoult's Lex? Smart, evil, insanely punchable. Mr. Terrific needs a spinoff. Krypto is chaos incarnate... James Gunn absolutely nailed it!! I have way more thoughts, but no spoilers. Just go see it on the BIG screen. ASAP!! Loved the depiction of the Luthercorp employees in Superman. They weren't mustache-twilering psychopath henchmen. They were just regular everyday Americans showing up to their job every day even though their company founder/CEO was a ""genius"" driven by envy, bigotry, and greed. 1",superman blew me away weird heartfelt chaotic in the best way feel like real comic book come to life not just studio slop corenswet just is superman his scene with lois had me grinning like an idiot,James gunn absolutely nailed it have way more thought but no spoiler just go see it on the big screen asap loved the depiction of the luthercorp employee in superman they were not mustache twilering psychopath henchman they,superman blew me away weird heartfelt chaotic in the best way feel like real comic book come to life not just studio slop corenswet just is superman his scene with lois had me grinning like an idiot hoult lex smart evil insanely,james gunn did it again went in skeptical fully burned out on superhero movie but superman blew me away weird heartfelt chaotic in the best way feel like real comic book come to life not just studio slop corenswet just is super

"A Masterpiece of Directorial Self-Indulgence SPOILER 1:Exhibitionism of the camera In this film, James Gunn's obsession with close-ups reaches pathological levels. A shattered Lex Luthor wineglass? OK, let's give a close-up shot. A child waving a Superman flag? Interminable close-up. It seemed as if the director was constantly showing off to the audience: ""Look at my composition!"" If the director's noble intention was to make the audience constantly aware of their distance from the film, thereby giving them time to go back to real life and look around the awkward atmosphere, then he indeed achieved this. 2:The Physics of Boredom The battle scenes of Superman were supposed to show a powerful kinetic impact force. However, every scene shot by Gunn was inferior to the action scenes in ""Mission: Impossible"". The scene involving entering the pocket universe was simply like shooting a computer screen saver. I even wondered if he didn't hire a martial arts director at all. 3:Narrative Metastasis from GotG I admit that Gunn is good at shooting ensemble dramas, but he is a bit too stuck in his comfort zone, resulting in Superman being portrayed as Guardians of the Galaxy. Here, supporting characters swarm like narrative locusts, there are numerous pirated rocket raccoons and witty rogue heroes who advance the plot, while Clark Kent becomes a guest star in his own film. 4: Structural bankruptcy of editing The film's 130 minutes feel simultaneously rushed and interminable. Jump cuts during the climax of the film suggest an editor fighting to salvage foundationless stakes-a climax without crescendo. And the ""comedic"" (in fact, not at all funny) forced delay also seemed out of place. Apart from Kent and Luthor, the motives of the other characters are ambiguous, illogical and simply incomprehensible. I don't care whether Gunn's Superman has accurately recreated the image in the minds of comic fans or not. Gunn's fundamental failure is prioritizing directorial ""voice"" over cinematic discipline. It even has to be pointed out, the noise issues in several night scenes were quite noticeable and excessive. This was truly a technical blunder, yet it was approved by the director. I'm really curious about how the director managed to save money. 4",the director noble intention wa to make the audience aware of their distance from the film thereby giving them time to go back to real life and look around the awkward atmosphere then he achieved this the physic of boredom the battle scene of,James gunn obsession with close ups reach pathological level.

"Super mid Seen the movie and it didn't lived to the expectations. It was too much James Gunn all over the place. If you aim the movie to please the kids then it did the job if the aim of this movie was to bring a general audience of all age I think it failed. Krypto was annoying, Jor El... not sure if that's Jor El or Space Diddy. Plenty of rushed scenes where Gunn didn't let the emotions to soak in but rushes into another scene. Cgi for today's times where we are more advanced technological is on the level of a CW TV series. Story isn't really great and no worth noty music which could elevate the scenes better. Last complaint about the movie and its the first superman movie since Brandon Routh and H. Cavill and this should be a solo superman movie not a team up. Good parts?

"Superman 2025: No plot needed when there's heart. SPOILER I don't get the people saying they ""didn't connect with the plot."" This movie doesn't need a complex plot. It's a Superman adventure, a living comic book where Superman is already who he is. No need to explain where he comes from or why he does what he does - he is already Superman, and that's more than enough to give us a rich, dynamic, and emotionally layered story. Every character has depth, even the ones that seem secondary. Superman's relationship with humanity - with those who betray him or believe in him - is nuanced and beautiful. He's not a god. He's hope. He's more human than humans because he still believes in us, even when we don't deserve it. Krypto was a highlight. Supergirl's short scene was impactful. And The Engineer absolutely steals the movie - a visually stunning, cold, complex character played brilliantly by María Gabriela de Faría. Venezuelan pride on screen!

"Not perfect, but definitely worth watching. The new Superman film delivers a fresh and visually striking take on the iconic superhero. The performance of the lead actor brings a strong, charismatic presence to Clark Kent, while the film balances action and emotion effectively. The visuals are impressive, especially during the major battle sequences, and the soundtrack adds a powerful emotional layer to the story. The story offers some thoughtful moments and modern updates, though it occasionally plays it safe and follows a familiar formula. Some supporting characters could have been more developed, and the pacing in the second act feels a bit uneven. Overall, it's a solid and entertaining reboot that respects the legacy of Superman while setting the stage for future installments. Fans will appreciate the nods to the comics and the heartfelt moments scattered throughout the film. 0",the new superman film delivers fresh and visually striking take on the iconic superhero the performance of the lead actor brings strong charismatic presence to clark kent . the film balance action and emotion effectively the visuals are impressive especially during the major,The new superman film delivers fresh and visually striking take on the iconic superhero the performance of the lead actor brings strong charismatic presence to clark kent.

"Omg, that hurts This movie feels like a complete misfire. The tone is all over the place - one moment it seems like a cartoon for 6-year-olds, the next it throws in brutal violence. Lex Luthor screams like a maniac, Superman himself acts unstable and aggressive, and even his dog is portrayed as hyperactive and unhinged. Instead of mythic gravitas, we get over-the-top tantrums. Visually, it doesn't look like a $200 million blockbuster. Many scenes are shot way too close, giving the impression of a TV series or even a cheap TV movie. The so-called ""battlefield"" looks like a repurposed BMX track with a few extras running up the hill - sometimes even the exact same shot reused. It's hard not to feel insulted as a viewer. On top of that, it's an absolute catastrophe for anyone with basic geographical knowledge to hear such ridiculous fake country names like Boravia. It feels lazy, almost insulting. They could have done better research - or simply asked ChatGPT for help - instead of serving the audience this nonsense. What's worse, the attempt to inject ""Guardians of the Galaxy""-style humor completely falls flat. That irreverent comedy works in space with a talking raccoon and a tree - but here it just undermines Superman's mythic tone. The result feels chaotic, soulless, and directionless. I honestly feel sorry for Henry Cavill and Dwayne Johnson - they dodged a bullet by not being part of this mess. And I truly feel bad for the cast here, because I'm convinced they could have delivered so much more if they hadn't been wasted on poor direction and incoherent storytelling. Compared to the heart, depth, and organic storytelling of the Arrowverse's Supergirl or even the classic Christopher Reeve films, this one is a disaster. 2",omg that hurt this movie feel like complete misfire the tone is all over place one moment it seems like cartoon for year old the next it throw in brutal violence lex luthor scream like maniac super,"""This movie feel like complete misfire the tone is all over the place one moment it seems like cartoon for year old the next it throw in brutal violence lex luthor scream like maniac superman himself act unstable and aggressive and even his dog",The tone is all over the place one moment it seems like cartoon for year old the next it throw in brutal violence lex luthor scream like maniac superman himself act unstable and aggressive and even his dog is portrayed hyperactive and unhinged instead,omg that hurt this movie feel like complete misfire the tone is all over the place one moment it seems like cartoon for year old the next it throw in brutal violence lex luthor scream like maniac superman himself act unstable and aggressive and even

"SOOOOOOO DISAPPOINTED.. I really liked Henry Cavill as Superman. He was strong and tough. He was also awesome looking. I think it was a huge mistake to change superman actors. This touchy, feely theme was an absolute mess. I think people watched it, because there were not very many new movies out. So, they just got lucky. I should've waited until it came on TV free in 2 years. I loved the Superman movie with Henry Cavill. He fought the aliens from his home planet well. It was believable and awesome. However, this new movie was a waste. I was so disappointed. I like a tough Superman that wins. The actress that played Mrs. Lane the reporter was horrible and dressed like an absolute bum.

"James Gunn's Superman I was a bit skeptical going to see this movie. So many actors have donned the blue tights over the years. To me Christopher Reeve was the Superman I grew up with and in my opinion was the best actor to play the man of steel in the movies. Henry Cavill was probably my 2nd favorite actor to wear the cape so I was disappointed that Gunn decided to recast the role for this movie. But I can now say that David Corenswet was an excellent choice as Clark Kent/Superman. The movie is not an origin story, it has established Superman as being in action for years. We are introduced to him right away. The story can be a bit confusing if you don't follow the comic books as much as I did especially the supporting characters that are not well known (Metamorpho, Mr. Terrific. Etc.) but the action is non stop excitement! Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane has excellent chemistry with Corenswets Superman, Nathan Fillion is funny as the Superhero Guy Gardner and Nicholas Hoult makes for an interesting and pure evil Lex Luthor. The movie has some great cameos as well but one of the biggest scene stealers is Krypto the Superdog who is absolutely adorable. It was an absolute terrific movie and I'm glad that James Gunn is in charge now.

"Bad movie, RIP Superman and Lois This movie was overall very underwhelming. The pacing, the story, and much more. The overuse of cgi and the constant swinging of the tone of the movie. It all feels like a money grab, but then again, what movie isn't these days. In my opinion, it was a really bad movie from CW's new owners. To replace Superman and Lois with this 'Superman' was.. I mean cmon. 2",bad movie rip superman and lois this movie wa overall very underwhelming the pacing the story and much more the overuse of cgi and the constant swinging of the tone of the movie it all feel like,"""This movie wa overall very underwhelming the pacing the story and much more the overuse of cgi and the constant swinging of the tone of the movie it all feel like money grab but then again what movie is not these day in my",This movie wa very underwhelming the pacing the story and much more the overuse of cgi and the constant swinging of the tone of the movie it all feel like money grab .<n>This superman wa mean cmon,bad movie rip superman and lois this movie wa overall very underwhelming the pacing the story and much more the overuse of cgi and the constant swinging of the tone of the movie it all feel like money grab but then again what movie
"Absolutely awesome! The most closed to comic. Even though I'm also a fan of Henri Cavill's version, I must admit that this new Superman movie is one of the best Superman films ever made, after the Christopher Reeves' version. This new Superman movie was highly recommended, and I commend James Gunn for delivering a great performance. If you're a true fan of Superman, you should definitely watch this movie. Don't miss out on it just because you're a fan of Henry Cavill. This is the best Superman film ever made, after the Christopher Reeves' version. The storyline is meaningful and engaging, portraying the most human Superman yet. The portrayal of Lex Luther is also impressive, and the special effects are awe-inspiring. And let's not forget the adorable Krypton Doggy! Overall, this is a great DC reboot, and I can't wait to see the rest of the series. Well done, James Gunn! 1",this new superman movie wa highly recommended and commends james gunn for delivering great performance if you are true fan of superman this is the best superman film ever made after the christopher reef version .,This is one of the best superman film ever made after the christopher reef version.

"Perhaps the Worst Production Ever Utterly atrocious. I never review film, but I consider this a public service, as a film has never made me angrier. I implore you, avoid this abhorrent catastrophe at all costs. There are countless points of how this film is an insult to entertainment. Laughable writing, literally zero concentric story, utterly shambolic use of previously great creation, to name but a few. The fact that they had the audacity to use the genius of John Williams and Richard Donner in this film is utterly inconceivable. Donner will be turning in his grave. If you fancy a trip to the cinema, don't waste your time. Have a nice night in, you'll thank yourself. 15",ha never made me angrier implore you avoid this abhorrent catastrophe at all cost there are countless point of how this film is an insult to entertainment laughable writing literally zero concentric story utterly shambol,"""This film is an insult to entertainment laughable writing literally zero concentric story utterly shambolic use of previously great creation to name but few"" ""The fact that they had the audacity to use the genius of john williams and",perhaps the worst production ever utterly atrocious never review film but consider this public service film ha never made me angrier implore you avoid this abhorrent catastrophe at all cost .<n>Few the fact that they had the audacity to use the genius of john,perhaps the worst production ever utterly atrocious never review film but consider this public service film ha never made me angrier implore you avoid this abhorrent catastrophe at all cost there are countless point of how this film is an insult to entertainment laughable writing
"Supeman is way to nerfed. SPOILER As a big fan of DC comics, I have to say that it's really challenging to create live-action movies that are nearly as good as the comics or animated films. However, Superman feels significantly nerfed in this movie. He gets beaten multiple times, only uses his heat vision once at the end, and demonstrates his ice breath just twice-one time to save a random dog on the street. On the positive side, I appreciated the portrayal of Lex Luthor. He comes across as intelligent and cunning, but I can't shake the thought that he allowed his girlfriend to record selfies and videos around his secret plans. Shouldn't a guy like him, who is supposed to be one of the smartest people in the world, be more careful? I also enjoyed his connection with Krypto, which led to some funny moments. The choice of Guy Gardner as a Green Lantern is intriguing (for those who read the comics, you know he's often seen as the biggest jerk among the Lanterns). If they had chosen Hal Jordan or another character, they might have provided more assistance. What really frustrates me is that he doesn't intervene while Metropolis is falling apart due to a massive crack in the earth, but he does go to stop the war. The concept of a Superman clone at the end is a clever twist that explains why he couldn't defeat it. Overall, it's not a bad movie, but it has many flaws. I hope the next one will be better. 1",superman feel significantly nerfed in this movie he get beaten multiple time only us his heat vision once at the end and demonstrates his ice breath just twice one time to save random dog on the street on the positive side appreciated the,Superman feel significantly nerfed in this movie he get beaten multiple time only us his heat vision once at the end and demonstrates his ice breath just twice one time to save random dog on the street on the positive side appreciated the portrayal of lex,superman feel significantly nerfed in this movie he get beaten multiple time only us his heat vision once at the end .<n> appreciated the portrayal of lex luthor he come across intelligent and cunning but cannot shake the thought that he allowed,supeman is way to nerfed spoiler big fan of dc comic have to say that it is really challenging to create live action movie that are nearly good the comic or animated film however superman feel significantly nerfed in this movie he get beaten multiple
"Now for something completely random SPOILER I give the movie a solid 6. Krypto the dog was the best part of it. Also the James Gunnisms like fight scenes to fun music and random characters. Other than that, you could watch a lot of this film while listening to music or without audio and it wouldn't really impact anything. A lot of pointless dialogue. An example is a part where 6 people are walking to the Dr. Robotnik flying ship and they are saying a bunch of things, but I stopped listening because it just didn't matter. They were walking to the ship that's what the scene was it didn't need the dialogue. There are many scenes like this. Superman isn't very supery in the movie. He can get destroyed pretty bad but then comeback from it. Throughout the movie I just kept thinking is this a mockery of superman and some of the DC characters? It is meant to be a spoof on them and make them look ridiculous like Green Lantern? I enjoyed the good parts but I am not sure what the rave is all about around the movie except its super different and random. 10",spoiler gives the movie solid krypto the dog wa the best part of it also the james gunnisms like fight scene to fun music and random character other than that you could watch lot of this film while listening to music,Krypto the dog wa the best part of it also the james gunnisms like fight scene to fun music and random character. lot of pointless dialogue an example is part where people are walking to the dr robotnik flying ship and,krypto the dog wa the best part of it also the james gunnisms like fight scene to fun music and random character .<n>An example is part where people are walking to the dr robotnik flying ship and they are saying,now for something completely random spoiler give the movie solid krypto the dog wa the best part of it also the james gunnisms like fight scene to fun music and random character other than that you could watch lot of this film while listening
"UnSuperman Hmm where do I start. From the overdone story, assuming we need to know exactly where Supes is at this very point in the story, too many characters stuffed our way to get more backstory movies and dynasty set up. Its a bit much. Just stick to his story, with 1 enemy, simple and then tease another villain at the end like Marvel used to. It seems this movie was not about Supes as much as launching a whole franchise and used this movie as it 2 hour long billboard. And there still is that cookie monster eye in the flying scene LOL. But if you are a fan of colorful stuff and loud effects, you may enjoy this. But no thanks. Save your money and wait for stream. 40",unsuperman hmm where do start from the overdone story assuming we need to know exactly where supes is at this very point in the story too many character stuffed our way to get more backstory movie and,Unsuperman is an hour long billboard.

"Entertaining Yes, it was worth the money you pay, the actor is good as superman. The plot was predictable but still entertaining. Alright let's tackle the comparison: Man of steel is way better, the way I believe superman should be portrayed in real life. I have nothing against the new one but... Getting rid of Henry was like if Marvel would have decided to get rid of Hugh Jackman as wolverine. I still believe in what Gunn might have in mind, But please please: Stop trying to make DC characters funny by force, or try to make them adjust to what today's humor has come to. Remember all of this super heroes were written DECADES AGO, so trying to rewrite them for today's standard is a no no, that's why Nolan's trilogy is untouchable. 1",entertaining yes it wa worth the money you pay the actor is good superman the plot wa predictable but still entertaining alright let tackle the comparison man of steel is way better the way believe superman should be portrayed in real life have nothing against the,"""Man of steel is way better the way believe superman should be portrayed in real life have nothing against the new one but getting rid of henry wa like if marvel would have decided to get rid of hugh jackman wolverine",It wa worth the money you pay the actor is good superman the plot wa predictable but still entertaining alright .<n>henry wa like if marvel would have decided to get rid of hugh jackman wolverine still believe in what gunn might have,entertaining yes it wa worth the money you pay the actor is good superman the plot wa predictable but still entertaining alright let tackle the comparison man of steel is way better the way believe superman should be portrayed in real life have nothing against
